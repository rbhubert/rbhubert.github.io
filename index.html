                        <p>I’m developing a chatbot empowered with OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) to answer company-specific queries. The chatbot's design ensures the confidentiality of corporate data by relying solely on database metadata and prompts. </p>
                        <p> In an iterative process, I have successfully undertaken a series of Python and Pandas tasks to craft and implement the chatbot's diverse capabilities. These tasks include:</p>
                        <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Module for user query comprehension: continuously refining the chatbot's ability to comprehend user queries within the specific context of the company's datasets and industry terminology. This ensures precise and relevant responses tailored to user needs.</li>
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Module for dataset identification: ensuring the identification of relevant dataset(s) to significantly increase query resolution efficiency.</li>
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Module for response data retrieval: model that generate Python and Pandas code that seamlessly retrieves response data from the correct datasets. Additionally, I have integrated a robust 'debugger' mechanism to gracefully handle exceptions, ensuring uninterrupted performance.</li>
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Module for natural language response: constantly refining the formulation of natural language responses generated by the chatbot. By adapting responses based on the acquired data, I am able to elevate user satisfaction by providing contextually accurate and engaging interactions.</li>

                        <div class="subheading mb-3">Globant</div>
                        <p>I played a pivotal role in architecting a robust data pipeline within Azure Synapse Analytics, facilitating seamless access to vital financial insights for auditors. My technical expertise, encompassing Python, PySpark, and SQL, was instrumental in accomplishing the following key responsibilities:</p>
                        <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Data transformation and organization: employing Python, PySpark, and SQL, I skillfully processed and organized raw financial data sourced from various data vendors. Applying intricate business rules, I meticulously filtered and refined the financial information, ultimately channeling it into structured Delta Lake tables.</li>
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span>
                            Data flow pipeline development: a highlight of my contribution was the design and implementation of a dynamic Data Flow pipeline. This innovative solution not only orchestrated the transformation process but also replicated the refined Delta tables into a dedicated SQL Pool. This integration ensured a harmonized consistency and unwavering data integrity across all related tables.</li>
                            <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span> 
                            Stakeholder engagement and communication: my role extended beyond technical prowess to effective stakeholder management. I maintained proactive communication channels with the client, delivering regular updates on project progress. Furthermore, I facilitated collaborative discussions to understand evolving requirements and newly introduced business rules, thereby ensuring the solution's relevance and responsiveness to client needs.</li>

                        <p> I developed a dynamic web tool using Python and Flask, designed to visually represent and analyze aid requests submitted by citizens. This initiative helped my hometown government's response capabilities during the challenging times of the COVID-19 outbreak. Key highlights of my contribution include:
                            <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
                                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span> 
                                    Empowering data insights: By implementing cutting-edge clustering algorithms, I empowered the local government with valuable insights extracted from the aid requests. These insights were pivotal in identifying trends and patterns in citizen requests, laying the groundwork for informed decision-making.
                                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-xs"></i></span> 
                                    Strategic resource allocation: Leveraging the geolocation data embedded in the aid requests, I devised strategic approaches to allocate resources based on both request type and geographical location. This proactive strategy ensured that citizens received timely and targeted assistance, optimizing the government's response efforts.</li>
